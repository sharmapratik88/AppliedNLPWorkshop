# Analytics Vidhya's Datahack 2019 Applied Natural Language Processing Workshop
Repository of contents (+notebooks) covered in AV's Datahack Summit 2019 workshop on Applied NLP by **Sudalai Rajkumar**
## Workshop: Applied Natural Language Processing - Sudalai Rajkumar (SRK)
### Structure of the Workshop
1. Introduction to Natural Language Processing
2. Text pre-processing and Wrangling
    - Removing HTML tagsnoise
    - Removing accented characters
    - Removing special characterssymbols
    - Handling contractions
    - Stemming
    - Lemmatization
    - Stop word removal
3. Project: Build a duplicate character removal module
4. Project: Build a spell-check and correction module
5. Project: Build an end-to-end text pre-processor
6. Text Understanding
    - POS (Parts of Speech) Tagging
    - Text Parsing
        - Shallow Parsing
        - Dependency Parsing
        - Constituency Parsing
    - NER (Named Entity Recognition) Tagging
7. Project: Build your own POS Tagger
8. Project: Build your own NER Tagger
9. Text Representation – Feature Engineering
    - Traditional Statistical Models – BOW, TF-IDF
    - Newer Deep Learning Models for word embeddings – Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
10. Project: Similarity and Movie Recommendations
11. Project: Interactive exploration of Word Embeddings
12. Case Studies for other common NLP Tasks
    - Project: Sentiment Analysis using unsupervised learning and supervised learning (machine and deep learning)
    - Project: Text Clustering (grouping similar movies)
    - Project: Text Summarization and Topic Models
13. Promise of Deep Learning for NLP, Transfer and Generative Learning
14. Final words and where to go from here?
